                <p>I was part of CCNY racing, the City College of New York Baja SAE team, where we designed and manufactured an all-wheel drive all-terrain vehicle. My role consisted of converting a two-wheel drive to an all wheel drive all terrain veichle. This transition required us to not only put an emphasis on maintaining strutural intergerity within the Baja but communication and collabrative teamwork was crucial to ensure a well constructed assmembly. As a member of the powertrain system, I worked on making sure that the new powertrain design had power the from the engine transfered to both the back and front wheels of the Baja . This consisted of making sure gear ratios outputed desired torque and speed, designing a clutch pack, to transfer power to the front wheels, and designing housings for differntials.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">Team Lead</p>
                <p> My team and I were intrested on the working mechanism of industrial shredders given their destructive power to shred objects in to pieces through the use of shear stress. Given that they're used in buisness enviorments and large scale recylcing plants, we decided to design and manufature a minature sized shredder for our porject. The initial concept of our design was modeleded and drafted on CAD. Following our design, we manufactured and machined our parts using proper GD&T guidelines to ensure proper fitment and assembly of our model.</p>

                <h2> FEA Analysis of a Steel-Shaft-and-Pulley design </h2>
                <p>A steel pulley and shaft design was analyzed given some boudary conditions and basic guidance on how FEA software. Given two boundary conditions, a 100 N-m torque was applied to one face of the shaft and the pulley was restrained on one of its cutouts, I had to validate whether the design of the machined parts were subject to failure. Ultimately, through a convergence test, a sensitivty test, and careful analysis of the design, I was able to evaluate the design. This project gave me a solid foundation on the reliability of FEA results along with an understanding on how FEA software works.</p>

The problems consisted of vibrational sounds when moving the board, uneven wheels, and an unasthetic looking board. Vibrational sounds occured due to the boards slamming on the pipes within the frame when it was in motion. To resolve this issue, felt was placed in between the boards and pipes to get rid of noise all together. For the uneven wheels, set screws, locknuts, and locktite were used in order to properly leevl the wheels. The whiteboard was spray painted and shelves were laser cut and screwed on for supply storage along with being able present an fresh astethic look to the board.  </p>

As a result, not only did I learn more about fituring and feeds and speeds but the calibration of the machine itself played a major role in creating the product as I learned being a couple thousandths of millimeters off resulted to a failed first run. </p>

                <p>At Actasys I worked with a design team to test the efficiency of pizeoelectric, synthetic jet, actuators based on their respective use case. These mechanisms were modeled and assembled in SolidWorks. We worked on designing, testing, and fabricating linear and rotational models in order to determine the best configuration needed to have an effective actuator. What I learned in this internship revolved around designing and assembling mechanisms and solving problems whithin the mechanisms themselves. Problems consisted of plastics not working together properly, ineffecient use of actuators, toleracing issues, fixtures, and vibrational issues.  </p>

This includes maintaining a lab of FDM and SLA printers, coordinating efficient production schedules for our printers, and providing design changes to models for manufacturability purposes. Softwares such as Materialise Madigs, Preform, and Prusa slicer have given me a great insight on nuesances that come when desiging for 3D printing. Being able to print models in different scales has allowed me to bridge uncertanties between a scaled model on screen and an actual life sized print.  </p>

                <p>Given dimensions from a client based drawing, I was tasked to model a skeleton liquor decanter to the best of my ability. This proved to be a challanging task where organic curves made up a majority of the model. Ultimately, with this design project I was able to enahnce my modeling skills by learning advanced surface modeling techniques. Techniques included deleting faces, trimming surfaces, lofting surfaces, thickneing knitted surfaces only after making sure no surfaces are intersecting, etc. In addition, I learned the restraints that come with surface modeling, such as the extent at which the radius of a sketch can curve.  </p>
